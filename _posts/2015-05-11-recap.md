### personal

- Friday: family dinner featuring spaghetti, burning all things (okay fine, just the tree trimmings that I had piled up)
- Saturday: treating, overseeding, mowing grass before rain (it didn't...)
    - brother watched kiddos, so yay date night:
        - walked over bridge and then to pub downtown: beer + fish + chips = mmm
        - watched new `Avengers` movie, liked it
- Sunday: flowers for Mom, visiting, stabbed her pool with a knife (to drain it and make way for the new one)
- finally got everybody to finish the reference/recommendation forms for on my GA Tech Graduate Program application so now we wait to see if I'm in or not
- bought Witcher 2 on Steam sale, might even play it one day, eventually, sometime in the distant future
- __-1 healthy offspring__, ear infection, possibly bronchitus :-/
- my wife quit her job due to her crazy ex-boss, got a full two weeks pay and a payout for her unused vaction, could be worse


### projects

- playing with [parse](https://parse.com) a little bit, seems pretty great
- at work: builing new modeling language based on `MP2` but simpler and more modern
- cleaning iTunes library a bit, smarter smart playlists, fixed a few odd issues here and there
- finally finished reading new employee handbook so that I can call that done
- grooming household TODO lists with the wife
