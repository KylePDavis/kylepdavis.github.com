### personal

- Thursday - Sunday - awesome vacation at Rock On The Range in Columbus, OH
    - awesome bands
- Monday - day off to recover, yay


### projects

- at work: new modeling language up on GitHub now, needs renamed but currently called [model-lang](https://github.com/RiveraGroup/model-lang)
- `MongoDB Workbench` - working through prerelease TODO list
    - will probably publish to GitHub soon as v0.0.1-pre or something even if it isn't ready for a tagged release
    - got ES6 working (with `harmony_arrow_functions`) for both the browser and renderer processes
    - reorganized files to be a little more sane
    - my shortlist for the v0.0.1 release: doc update page, map reduce page, keybindings, docs, tests
