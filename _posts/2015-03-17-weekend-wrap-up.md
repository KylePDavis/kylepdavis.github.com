### tech tid bits

- got Ubuntu 15.04 working
    - initially couldn't get the video to work so it just "got stuck" at the startup messages
        - got it working by uninstalling my nvidia driver and installing a newer nvidia package
- [typescript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript)
    - the v1.4 that you get when you `npm install typescript` is nice but after playing with `babel` I keep trying unsupported things
    - that said, the roadmap on GitHub is exciting and most of what I want is in v1.5 so I'll be playing with that ASAP


### projects

- [dotfiles](https://github.com/KylePDavis/dotfiles)
    - finished getting this working in Linux and Mac OS X
    - fully switched over to using `gimme`
- [gimme](https://github.com/KylePDavis/gimme)
    - fix various Linux and Mac OS X issues
    - add more `my/*` gimmes to wrap up groups of tools


### professional

- trying to get my LinkedIn in order
- I am infomercial
    - I am interested in making things better, faster, and stronger.
    - I enjoy researching and providing consultation for the best tools for the job.
    - I have an aptitude for performance analysis, data analysis, data visualization, large systems, and automation.
    - I go further than most to find, understand, and fix the underlying cause of issues.
    - I want proof not politics.


### personal

- watched a crazy korean movie about ... wow...
