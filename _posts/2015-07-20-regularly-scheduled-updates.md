### personal

- went on vacation to California
	- had a fantastic time visiting with family
	- really like the San Francisco Bay area
	- got great pictures and neat slow motion videos
	- hiked around Mount Diablo with the kids
		- need to do more of that, they need to harden up, lol
	- walked the Golden Gate Bridge, really windy but lots of fun
	- visited the Jelly Belly jelly bean factory, my son is candy crazed now
	- fun at the California Academy of Sciences
	- went up and down the coast near Bodega Bay
	- visited Petaluma and unintentionally ended up at the same Irish pub that we went to 4 years ago
	- had a nice anniversary dinner alone with my wife at the same Melting Pot that we went to 4 years ago in the old brick kiln in Larkspur
- finally reading `Ready Player One`, about half-way through, pretty good so far
- found out that I got most of my 401K match money, not all, but most, so that's nice
- applying to a choice subset of jobs from the elaborate spreadsheet that I have been compiling


### projects
