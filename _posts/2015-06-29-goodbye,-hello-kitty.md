### personal

- lost my job at Rivera Group on Tuesday
	- shocked, confused, sad, not really sure what happened, may never know
	- the cited reasons were either approved by management weeks prior or half-baked at best
	- unfortunate timing, would have gained $5000 in my 401K only days later
	- wish people would've just talked about it so that it didn't have to end like this
	- would have liked to say goodbye to my friends and peers, I wish them nothing but the best
	- moving on, had a lot of offers in the meantime, so that is promising at least
	- working on my resume, site, and projects
	- interesting things on the west coast, the San Francisco Bay area
- birthday party for my daughter this week
	- Hello Kitty themed, which is much older than I realized
	- squirt guns, sprinkler, yard toys, tons of kids
	- full house, friends, family
	- had a great time, thanks to everyone


### projects

- [resume](https://github.com/KylePDavis/resume)
	- published to GitHub late today
	- used `html-pdf` and `roaster` for the conversions
	- used `gulp` for builds and deploys
	- added a button to the blog so that people can find it more easily
	- ran into a minor issue with my install of the Go Git Service, will have to resolve soon
