### projects

- [blog](https://github.com/KylePDavis/KylePDavis.github.io)
    - done importing most of the content
    - tweaking templates and styling
    - home stretch - will publish this week
- [model-lang](https://github.com/RiveraGroup/model-lang)
    - loving `typescript` 1.5-beta combined with `babel`
    - some `typescript` complaints with ES6 support but it compiles and works in the end
    - using both `visual-studio-code` and `atom` (w/ `atom-typescript`)
