### personal

- went to newport aquarium
    - after walking around the aquarium with the kids we dediced it would be fun to walk across the bridge right there
    - the kids had a blast
    - we got a ton of steps (read: earned calories with which we can "pay" for food)
    - went out to eat and ate and drank a lot :-)
- went to the walking bridge between Jeffersonville, IN and Louisville, KY
    - the kids decided that they wanted to run so we figured why not
    - they actually managed to make it most of the way (we're talking kindergarten and preschool here)
