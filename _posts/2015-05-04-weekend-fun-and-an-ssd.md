### personal

- Friday grill out: featuring steak
- Saturday: gloriously lazy day, project time
- Sunday: beers and badminton
- oddly successful: a big piece of foil left over in my grill seems to be keeping the birds from trying to build more nests
- yard work was cancelled on account of laziness (and not enough rain)
- donating blood today for the first time (should be interesting)


### projects

- got my new SSD
    - tried to use Disk Utility to clone the disk but it didn't go as nicely as I'd hoped
    - ended up using the trial of Carbon Copy Cloner to clone to my new SSD
    - LOVE MY NEW SSD
- `mongodb-workbench` (aka `mw`)
    - most things are working now
    - going through TODOs and prioritizing for a release
        - only the highest priority items will happen before the release
        - other items will become issues on github (with checkboxes for progress, probably)
- work:
    - `docker` -- still awesome... gotta love containers
    - `chef` -- still more painful that I'd like (their docs need work, not a big fan of Ruby really)
    - building a new event modeling language loosely based on [MP2](https://github.com/RiveraGroup/MP2)
- emoji fun
    - might start making commits in emoji
        - maybe *only* emoji, just to mess with people
