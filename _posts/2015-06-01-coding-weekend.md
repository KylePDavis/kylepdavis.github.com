### personal

- have lost 18.9 lbs so far, yay me, watching my food intake, hitting the treadmill daily doesn't hurt
- got a replacement collector beer glass for `@csexton`
- re-watched the movie `The DUFF` which was pretty funny
- watching the anime `Deadman Wonderland`


### projects

- playing w/ ES6 via `electron` flags (and `babel` for normal browsers)
- getting code correct w/ `tern`, `jshint`, `jscs`, and `eslint`
- work: [model-lang](https://github.com/RiveraGroup/model-lang)
    - enjoying ES6 generators and ES6 for better mocha tests
- [mongodb-workbench](https://github.com/KylePDavis/mongodb-workbench) - my MongoDB UI
    - on GitHub finally
    - needs work, but it's a start
    - might rename to `MongoUI`
- `resumes` - my resume in the open and in various open formats
