### personal
- Father's Day
    - spent the day visiting with my Dad and step-Mom
    - got a neat book "from the kids":
        - `The Mysterious World of Sherlock Holmes` by `Bruce Wexler`
- OMSCS @ GA Tech (Online Masters of Science in Computer Science at Georgia Tech)
    - formally accepted the offer into the graduate program
    - finished up some initial paperwork, more to come I'm sure
    - worked on financial aid paperwork, here come the student loans
- the beer fridge in my garage died
    - the beer is okay
    - lost a few freezer items
    - could've been worse
- watching Netflix a bit lately:
    - `Between`
    - `Agents of SHIELD`
- discovered `Smarter Every Day` videos, fun science
- found out that yet _another_ developer is leaving at work
    - later @jadelane, it's been great working with you!


### projects
- [blog](https://github.com/KylePDavis/KylePDavis.github.io)
    - all markdown, all the time
    - still enjoying this setup
    - will be fiddling with DNS to get [KylePDavis.com](http://KylePDavis.com) linked to my GitHub Pages site
- [mongodb-workbench](https://github.com/KylePDavis/mongodb-workbench)
    - cleaned up some inconsistencies between `eslint`, `jshint`, and `jscs`
    - working on resize and height issues for the `editor` component
    - trying to finish up a few more major issues before blabbing about it on Hacker News
- [resumes](https://github.com/KylePDavis/resumes)
    - tweaking a few things still
    - will try to publish on GitHub later this week
- `model-lang` - ~~https://github.com/RiveraGroup/model-lang~~  `(x_x)`
    - sadly, I was asked to remove this from GitHub
        - hope to get this posted back on GitHub once we resolve some internal issues
        - pretty sure there are mirrors of this Open Source code running around somewhere
    - becoming a `gulp` guru, making complicated build steps easy
        - going from `typescript` to `es6` thru `babeljs` to `es5`
        - using `gulp-load-plugins` to clean up the requires (and add lazy loading!)
        - using `browser-sync` with watchers to reload on changes
            - working but needs ore optimization before it's good enough
            - 20s rebuild times makes for whiny laptop fans
