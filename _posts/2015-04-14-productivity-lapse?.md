### personal

- yard work: part 1
    - done: overseed, fertilize, spread to prevent broadleaf, mow
    - pending: mulch, flowers, cutting down extra trees and shrubs
- a walk in the park
    - my cousin, his kids, our kids, always a fun time
    - stops for exercise
- made a habit of walking during lunch about a couple of weeks ago, feeling good, losing weight
- finishing up my application to GA Tech to work on my Masters degree in Computer Science


### projects

- `mongosaurus` - my MongoDB IDE
    - was able to work out the kinks when refactoring it to simply loop over a list of plugins
    - nearly back up and running and will put on GitHub soon
    - excited to build in support for [mungedb-aggregate](https://github.com/kylePDavis/mungedb-aggregate), [ace](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace) editor language plugins, and various data visualiation tools
    - considering spinning it off into a full blown little big data workbench kind of tool (little big data, I like that...)
- `resumes` - my attempt at Markdown resumes
    - coming along
    - had to fix an issue where the scrollbars were showing in the printed output (oops)
- misc
    - playing with [PEG.js](https://github.com/pegjs/pegjs) and parsers again
    - looking for an excuse to play with:
        - [marko](https://github.com/raptorjs/marko) - a nice HTML templating engine from eBay
        - Joyent's Triton (Linux on SmartOS using Docker at bare metal speeds)
        - [density](https://github.com/centaurean/density) - a superfast compression library
    - read a nice article on creating [Custom Elements](http://michaelmac.org/semantic-ui,/custom-elements,/ampersand,/backbone/2015/04/08/custom-elements-to-solve-simple-problems.html)
