### personal

- birthday dinner for wifey
    - steak + chicken fajitas in a pita pocket? WAT? YUM! that's what.
    - a silly string mishap
- went to Columbus, OH for a rock concert for one of my wife's favorite bands
    - she got some good happy birthday messages, here are a couple of fun ones:
        - [doctor who dance](https://i.giphy.com/FpDa6nn82xrSE.gif)
        - "it's sherbert day" caption on a picture of sherbert
        - a happy birthday song from Cara as soon as she answered the phone
- lazy Sunday
- the weekend is never long enough


### projects

- working on getting my blog up and running on GitHub Pages
    - originally wanted to build a simple single page app using JavaScript to load/render markdown files
    - considering using a static generator like `jekyll` instead so that I get better search engine support
    - might build some JS on top of the static output to dynamically change sections of the static pages to get a nice mix of the two
    - using and loving the [Cloud9](https://c9.io) editor
        - except some weird issues refreshing inline preview (new tab is fine)
        - want to setup live reload for this
