### personal

- it's been so long since I've updated this site that we're practically strangers
    - hi, I'm Kyle, nice to meet you
    - I moved to California: it is amazing here
    - wonderful weather, great people
    - amazing foods, fresh produce, obligatory avocado addiction
    - love it!
    - living the dream!!!
- so I have worked at Apple for a bit and ...
    - a) I absolutely love it!
    - b) I can't really talk about it.
- sold my car
    - wat? yes, I really did sell my beloved 2015 VW GTI
    - why? because I rarely drive anywhere anymore
    - how? bus, legs, my wife's car, etc.
- still trying to be healthy
    - being more active, walking a bunch, working out a bit
    - got an Apple Watch now (duh)
    - it helps nag me into moving around and doing stuff
    - the Apple Watch is fantastic, I love it, seriously, go get one! so worth it!
- OMG OMG OMG! break out puzzle rooms!
    - we did one while visiting back in Louisville, KY over the holidays
    - liked it so much that we did another before we left
    - another one in CA once we got back
        - actually failed to get out of this one on time
        - we knew that we didn't have a enough people going in
        - did it anyway just for the fun of it
        - they let us finish the room even though we failed so that we could see all of the puzzles
        - it was a great time hanging out with some of our new friends in town
    - and then another one which was a bit too easy but still had fun
    - and then yet another which was great, kind of like being in an Indiana Jones movie
    - they're super fun and I highly recommend that you go out and try one immediately
    - you read it right here on the Internet so it must be true
    - so go ahead.. now... right now, I'll wait... back? ok great. :-)
