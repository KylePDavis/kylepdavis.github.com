### personal

- went to the [City Museum](http://www.citymuseum.org) with Josh and Sarah and Aaron
	- I love that place -- a great big playground full of interesting arty things
	- Ayla and Fefe hurt themselves... a lot... both bruise like crazy
	- got an extra day at the hotel so we could relax and even swim a little bit
	- later Ryan told Sarah that he likes her:
		- She said: Why?
		- He replied: Your not a monster and you don't eat people, that's why I like you.
- Spending time with family:
	- Birthdays! Me, Tracy (Mom-in-law), and Dad
		- My birthday... mmm Cheesecake Factory
		- Tracy's birthday... mmm Chinese food
		- Dad's birthday... let them eat cake. every. time. (j/k, thanks Linda!)
	- Cyan got her driver's license, woo!
	- Hanging out with Mom and Cyan:
		- Good food and fun playing with pastels
		- Got to see my brother for the first time in a while so that was nice
		- Ryan ran, tripped, and slid Wile-E-Coyote-style across the kitchen floor and into the corner of the island
			- had a scare and a pretty big welp
			- fine now, it went away
			- unlike the girls, we don't bruise that easily
- Hanging out with friends:
	- did reasonably well playing [Team Fortress 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Fortress_2) at Adam's LAN party
	- definitely got pummeled by the top tier players though
- Planning our move:
	- T minus 2 weeks
	- Downsizing and ditching stuff
	- backed up and ditched the last of my floppy disks... yes, floppy disks...
	- WHY U HAVE SO MANY THINGS!?
- Next up:
	- tonight: concert to see [Gemini Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_Syndrome) and [Avatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(Swedish_band))
	- weekend: epic moving party
	- moving into temporary housing until we find a permanent place (impending zoom)
