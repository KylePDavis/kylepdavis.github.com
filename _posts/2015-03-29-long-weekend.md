### personal

- extreme spring cleaning part 1: the great paintening
    - challenge: repaint the living room
    - difficulty: the dog that we used to have chewed through the wall in the corner so there will be drywall work
    - had tons of help from great friends and family (THANKS AGAIN!)
    - while repainting the living room we decided to repaint the hallway too
    - finished up with obligatory beer and pizza at BoomBozz (bbq chicken pizza omg)
    - the drywall in the corner took too long to dry so I had to wait until the next day to finish it
    - while moving stuff around to paint I guess managed to break the HDMI IR injectors for my TV so now I can't control the AppleTV without using the Apple Remote app on my iPhone. oops...
- working on my application to Georgia Tech's Online Masters of Computer Science Degree Program
    - it is slow going but I am making progress
    - making progress on updating (and modernizing my resume)
    - suddenly I realize that I have no references to speak of and a less than stellar GPA
    - I will prove myself, given the chance


### projects

- `resume`
    - still working on converting my resume to markdown
    - while doing this I realized that O'Rielly Media had quite a few things to say about this on their GitHub pages related to their atlas project (HTMLBook, asciidoc tools, markdown tools, HTML themes for books and typesetting)
    - also found [gitbook](http://gitbook.com/)
- `syntastic`
    - created a `jshint` checker for `json` files
        - why? because I do not like having to install additional tools when I already have tools that do the job
        - it mostly works but it allows comments which may not be desirable
        - next stop: let's see if I can add a `nocomment` option to `jshint` for this case (might be useful to disallow comments in some cases because it might force people to write better code)
